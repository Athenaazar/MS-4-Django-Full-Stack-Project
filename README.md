## ***Introduction***

### **Backend Development**
Full Stack Frameworks with Django Milestone Project.

This is my Fourth and last of Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute.

This project, is a full-stack site based around business logic. With an authentication and paiyment service mechanisms to purchase of a product/service.

### **Main Technologies**
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django

Relational database (recommending MySQL or Postgres)

Stripe payments

Additional libraries and APIs

### **Mandatory Requirements**
source: [code institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)
1. Django Full Stack Project: Build a Django project backend by a relational database to create a website that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.
1. Multiple Apps: The project must be a brand new Django project, composed of multiple apps (an app for each potentially reusable component in your project).
1. Data Modeling: Relational database schema well-suited for your domain. And relationships between entities. Create at least 2 custom django models.
1. User Authentication: The project should include an authentication mechanism, allowing a user to register and log in, and there should be a good reason as to why the users would need to do so.
1. User Interaction: Include at least one form with validation that will allow users to create and edit models in the backend (in addition to the authentication mechanism).
1. Use of Stripe: At least one of your Django apps should contain some e-commerce functionality using Stripe. This may be a shopping cart checkout or single payments, or donations, etc.
1. Structure and Navigation: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout.
1. Use of JavaScript: The frontend should contain some JavaScript logic you have written to enhance the user experience.
1. Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
1. Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
1. Attribution: Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
1. Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform Heroku.
1. Security: Not include any passwords or secret keys in the project repository, turn off the Django DEBUG mode, which could expose secrets.

https://docs.github.com/

https://docs.mongodb.com/

https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deployment
### **Fork A repository**
A Fork is a copy of repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without effecting the original project.

- Log-Into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").
- Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Raivis80/Milestone-Project-3)"Link to GitHub Repo".
- On GitHub, navigate to The [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Raivis80/Milestone-Project-3)" Link to my Repo".
- In the --right corner of the page, click Fork.

Detailed Steps for forking a repository from GitHub can be found here: [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
### **Creating a Clone Deploy Locally**
You can clone repository. When you clone repository, you copy repository to your Machine.
- Log-Into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").
- Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Raivis80/Milestone-Project-3)"Link to GitHub Repo".
- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Code dropdown tab.
- Select the Download ZIP from dropdown and unzip in your working directory
   Or clone repository in terminal copy and paste following GitHubCLI link

   ```
   gh repo clone Raivis80/Milestone-Project-3
   ```
- Run following command to install python packages are required to run this project requirements.txt 

   ```
   python -m pip -r requirements.txt
   ```
- SignIn/Create free MongoDB Atlas Database account
   - Create Database for this project named "top-DB" with following collections

   | Collection Name |
   | ---------- |
   | 1.  Categories |
   | 2.  Posts     |
   | 3.  Users      |

- Create env.py protect your passwords using environment variables while connecting to databases with Python. File should contain following.

![image](project_files/images/env.png)


- Replace The SECRET_KEY with your own and MONGO_URI and CLOUDINARY_URL provided by mongoDB.
Ensure to add env.py to a .gitignore file before pushing your code to your repository.

### **Deploying on Heroku Pages**
- After Cloning the repository now you are able to deploy on Heroku pages
- Before deployment Make sure to:
    - Create requirements.txt file in the same project directory use the following command

   ```
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

   ![image](project_files/images/requirements.PNG)

    - Create a Procfile in same directory that is required for all Heroku applications. to start the app. Enter Following in procfile.

   ```
   web: python app.py
   ```
- Log-Into [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) "Link to Heroku login page" or [create an account](https://signup.heroku.com/login) "Link to Heroku create account page".
- Once logged in, Find and select "Deploy" tab 
- After selecting "Deploy" tab find and Select Deployment method "GitHub"
- Now find and Select Connect to GitHub repository and select repository to connect to
- Now locate and select option and enable "Automattic Deploys"
- You can now select "Deploy Branch"
