# ***Introduction***

## **Full Stack Frameworks with Django Milestone Project.**


This is my Fourth and last of Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute.

This project, is a full-stack site based around business logic. With an authentication and payment service mechanisms to purchase of a product/service.

## **Main Technologies**
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django

Relational database (recommending MySQL or Postgres)

Stripe payments

Additional libraries and APIs

## **Mandatory Requirements**
source: [code institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)
1. Django Full Stack Project: Build a Django project backend by a relational database to create a website that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.
1. Multiple Apps: The project must be a brand new Django project, composed of multiple apps (an app for each potentially reusable component in your project).
1. Data Modeling: Relational database schema well-suited for your domain. And relationships between entities. Create at least 2 custom django models.
1. User Authentication: The project should include an authentication mechanism, allowing a user to register and log in, and there should be a good reason as to why the users would need to do so.
1. User Interaction: Include at least one form with validation that will allow users to create and edit models in the backend (in addition to the authentication mechanism).
1. Use of Stripe: At least one of your Django apps should contain some e-commerce functionality using Stripe. This may be a shopping cart checkout or single payments, or donations, etc.
1. Structure and Navigation: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout.
1. Use of JavaScript: The frontend should contain some JavaScript logic you have written to enhance the user experience.
1. Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
1. Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
1. Attribution: Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
1. Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform Heroku.
1. Security: Not include any passwords or secret keys in the project repository, turn off the Django DEBUG mode, which could expose secrets.

## **Fork A repository**
A Fork is a copy of repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without effecting the original project.

- Log-Into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").
- Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Raivis80/Milestone-Project-3)"Link to GitHub Repo".
- On GitHub, navigate to The [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Raivis80/(REPO NAME))" Link to my Repo".
- In the --right corner of the page, click Fork.

Detailed Steps for forking a repository from GitHub can be found here: [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
## **Creating a Clone Deploy Locally**
You can clone repository. When you clone repository, you copy repository to your Machine.
- Log-Into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").
- Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Raivis80/(REPO NAME))"Link to GitHub Repo".
- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Code dropdown tab.
- Select the Download ZIP from dropdown and unzip in your working directory
   Or clone repository in terminal copy and paste following GitHubCLI link

## **Deploying on Heroku Pages**
- After Cloning the repository now you are able to deploy on Heroku pages
- Before deployment Make sure to:
    1. Create requirements.txt file in the same project directory

        ```
         pip freeze > requirements.txt 
        ```
    2. Make sure your manage.py file is connected to your mysql database
        Use this command to backup your current database and load it into a db.json file:

        ```
        python3 manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
        ```
    
    3. Connect your manage.py file to your postgres database

        ``` 
        python3 manage.py loaddata db.json
        ```

    4. Install environment variable to configure your Django application.

        ```
        pip3 install dj_database_url
        ```
    
    5. Install PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language.

        ```
        pip3 install psycopg2-binary

    6. bload fixtures after migrate performed.

        ```
        python3 manage.py loaddata categories and products 

    7. Python Web Server Gateway Interface HTTP server.

        ```
        pip install gunicorn

    8. Add to a  Procfile ->

        ```
        web: gunicorn butique_ado.wsgi:application

    9. Run the heroku login  CLI command.

        ```
        heroku login -i

    10. Disable static file collection.

        ```
        heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app (APP NAME)

    11. Add to remote heroku main

        ```
        heroku git:remote -a (APP NAME)

    12. And.
    
        ```
        git push heroku main

Now you can add app to automaticly oush updates from git.
1. Log-Into [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) "Link to Heroku login page" or [create an account](https://signup.heroku.com/login) "Link to Heroku create account page".
2. Once logged in, Find and select "Deploy" tab 
3. After selecting "Deploy" tab find and Select Deployment method "GitHub"
4. Now find and Select Connect to GitHub repository and select repository to connect to
5. Now locate and select option and enable "Automattic Deploys"
6. You can now select "Deploy Branch"

8. Select within settings page "Reveal Config Vars and add following

| Config|	Vars |
| -- | -- |
| ALOWED_HOSTS | Your heroku deployment URL |
| SECRET_KEY |	Your secret key |
| S3_SECRET_KEY |	Your S3 secret key |
| STRIPE_SECRET | Your Stripe Key|

Add all stripe keys to heroku config variables STRIPE_SECRET.

Make sure to enter your own SECRET_KEY, Amazon AWS S3 S3_SCRET_KEY variables.
